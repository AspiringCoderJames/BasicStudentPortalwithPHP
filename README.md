# PHP using Xampp Server

Basic Student Portal: Register, Login, Check Grades, and Update Grades using the Admin Account

I have uploaded the code for a basic student portal. You can use it as a foundation for your future project. To utilize it effectively, you should learn how to use XAMPP Control Panel, PHPMailer (for sending OTP codes), and, of course, the fundamentals of PHP.

This is not yet finished, there are more changes to be made.
